Could use their query system to verify tickers

Have a default profile or a list of similar tickers
Run these through the function to replace each ticker
Compare results. If our recommended leads to a better output
Then return a string (not "") that says XXX ticker is recommended
|
-> Needs more functions so we can rerun the loop while switching out tickers

Might wantr to return a dictionary from first function then we can pass it to the final function
Then combine all df into one dictionary

Clean Up the get_data function  (ex: pass the send_data dict into the function calc it before the func)
