Could use their query system to verify tickers

Have scrape as a function that runs iters times
Have a default profile or a list of similar tickers
Run these through the function to replace each ticker
Compare results. If our recommended leads to a better output
Then return a string (not "") that says XXX ticker is recommended
|
-> Needs more functions so we can rerun the loop while switching out tickers

Think we are counting an error that isnt an error

Need a time check table
