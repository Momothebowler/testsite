Make the site anew or make this it's own site with its own home page and add more text and such
Maybe write up payment schemes
I want a nice and clean looking site with maybe some copyright free animated splash pages


Making profiles


Add question mark hover tooltips 


Could use their query system to verify tickers


We have posted tickers. Add our recommended to end of the list
Loop through the list to get the data while removing the tickers.
Combine data separately (might need to store the length of the original list or always keep it even)


Have a default profile or a list of similar tickers
Run these through the function to replace each ticker
Compare results. If our recommended leads to a better output
Then return a string (not "") that says XXX ticker is recommended
|
-> Needs more functions so we can rerun the loop while switching out tickers

Might wantr to return a dictionary from first function then we can pass it to the final function
Then combine all df into one dictionary

Clean Up the get_data function  (ex: pass the send_data dict into the function calc it before the func)
